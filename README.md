# Everyday-Market E-commerce

Everyday Market is an E-commerce React.JS web app.
It uses Bootstrap CSS classes to create the responsive web UI design on the Products and Cart page.
Root Component App is a parent to the other 4 component pagesâ€”i.e. Navbar, Home, Products and Cart.
It fetches product data from the in-app JSON file using React Axios.
As a top component, Navbar uses Routing to visit other pages provided by installing Recact-router-dom.
It allows user to add products in the cart and edit the cart by data sharing using props.
